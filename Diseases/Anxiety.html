For example, you may feel worried and anxious about sitting an exam or having a medical test or job interview. During times like these, feeling anxious can be perfectly normal.However, some people find it hard to control their worries. Their feelings of anxiety are more constant and can often affect their daily life.Anxiety is the main symptom of several conditions, including panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (social phobia).However, the information in this section is about a specific condition called generalised anxiety disorder (GAD).</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-3">When to see your Gp</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-4">Although feelings of anxiety at certain times are completely normal, you should see your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and your worries, fears and emotions to try to find out if you could have GAD.</p>

                    </span>
                    <br>GAD can cause a change in your behaviour and the way you think and feel about things, resulting in symptoms such as:.
                  </p>
                  <ul class="u-text u-text-8">
                    <li>restlessness</li>

                    <li>feeling constantly "on edge"</li>
                    <li>difficulty concentrating</li>
                    <li>irritability</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-9">Your symptoms may cause you to withdraw from social contact (seeing your family and friends) to avoid feelings of worry and dread.You may also find going to work difficult and stressful and may take time off sick.

                  <p class="u-text u-text-11"> See your GP if anxiety is affecting your daily life or is causing you distress.Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) can be difficult to diagnose. In some cases, it can also be difficult to distinguish from other mental health conditions, such as depression.<br>Your GP may ask you questions about your worries, fears and emotions. They may also ask about your personal life. Tell your GP about all your symptoms – physical and psychological – and explain how long you have had them for.You may find it difficult to talk about your feelings, emotions and personal life. However, it is important that your GP understands your symptoms and circumstances so that the correct diagnosis can be made.You are most likely to be diagnosed with GAD if you have had the symptoms for six months or more. Finding it difficult to manage your feelings of anxiety is also an indication that you may have the condition.<br>
                    <br>You may have generalised anxiety disorder if:<br>

                    <li>you have felt worried nearly every day for at least six months</li>

                  <h4 class="u-text u-text-13">Treating Anxiety</h4>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-14"> Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a long-term condition, but a number of different treatments can help.Before you begin any form of treatment, your GP should discuss all your treatment options with you. They should outline the pros and cons of each and make sure you are aware of any possible risks or side effects.With your GP, you can make a decision on the treatment most suited to you, taking into account your personal preferences and circumstances.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-15">Initial Help</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-16"> At first, your GP may suggest trying an individual self-help course for a month or two to see if it can help you learn to cope with your anxiety.This will usually involve working from a book or computer programme on your own (you will be given advice about how to use the book or programme before you start), with only occasional contact with your doctor.Alternatively, you may prefer to go on a group course where you and a few other people with similar problems meet with a therapist every week to learn ways to tackle your anxiety.</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-17">Psychological Treatment</p>
                  <p class="u-text u-text-18">If you have been diagnosed with GAD, you will usually be advised to try psychological treatment before you are prescribed medication.</p>
